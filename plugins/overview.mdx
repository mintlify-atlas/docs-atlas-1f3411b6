## Core Dependencies

The following plugins are core dependencies used by other plugins:

- **plenary.nvim** - Lua functions library used by many plugins
- **vim-tmux-navigator** - Seamless navigation between tmux panes and vim splits
- **nvim-web-devicons** - File icons for file explorers and status lines

## Plugin Management

nvim-luffy uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as its plugin manager. Plugins are organized in the `lua/leyland/plugins/` directory, with each major plugin having its own configuration file.

### Plugin Structure

```
lua/leyland/plugins/
├── init.lua           # Core dependencies
├── colorscheme.lua    # Theme configurations

## Key Features

### Lazy Loading

Many plugins are configured to lazy load based on:
- **Events** - Load when specific Neovim events occur
- **Keys** - Load when specific keybindings are pressed
- **Commands** - Load when specific commands are executed
- **File types** - Load for specific file types

This keeps startup time fast while ensuring all functionality is available when needed.

### Consistent Keybindings

All plugins follow a consistent keybinding scheme:
- `<leader>` (Space) - Primary prefix for custom commands
- `<leader>f` - File/Find operations (Telescope)
- `<leader>e` - File explorer toggle
- `<leader>h/H` - Harpoon operations
- `<leader>g` - Git operations

### Visual Consistency

All UI plugins are configured to work well together:
- Consistent icon usage via nvim-web-devicons
- Theme-aware colors
- Similar layout patterns
