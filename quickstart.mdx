## Your First 5 Minutes

This guide will get you from zero to productive with nvim-luffy. We'll cover the essential keybindings and workflows you need to start coding.

<Note>
  All keybindings in nvim-luffy use `Space` as the leader key. This guide uses `<leader>` to represent the Space key.
</Note>

## The Dashboard

When you first open Neovim, you'll see the One Piece-themed dashboard:

```
                    ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⠶⠶⠶⠶⠤⠤⠤⣄⣀
                ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⠔⠊⠉⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠛⠷⣦⣄⡀

        ⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⠴⠋⢀⡔⠉⠀⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⣵⣼⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢦⡀
        [One Piece ASCII art...]

        "Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."

                  Find file
                  Recent files
                  Quit
```

From here, you can:
- Press `f` to find files
- Press `r` to see recent files
- Press `q` to quit

## Essential Keybindings

### Finding and Opening Files

The fastest way to navigate your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fuzzy Find Files">
    ```vim
    <leader><leader>  # or Space Space
    ```

    Opens Telescope's file finder. Start typing to filter:
    - `init.lua` - finds files with "init" and "lua"
    - `user` - finds all files with "user" in the name

    **Navigation:**
    - `Ctrl+j` / `Ctrl+k` - Move down/up
    - `Enter` - Open file
    - `Esc` - Close
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search in Files">
    ```vim
    <leader>/  # Live grep
    ```

    Search for text across your entire project:
    - Type your search term
    - Results update in real-time
    - Press `Enter` to jump to the match

    ```vim
    <leader>fc  # Find word under cursor
    ```

    Instantly search for the word under your cursor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recent Files">
    ```vim
    <leader>fr
    ```

    Quick access to recently opened files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### File Explorer

When you need a tree view of your project:

```vim
<leader>e  # Toggle nvim-tree
```

**Inside nvim-tree:**
- `j` / `k` - Navigate up/down
- `l` - Open file or expand folder
- `h` - Close folder
- `a` - Create new file
- `d` - Delete file
- `r` - Rename file
- `y` - Copy file
- `p` - Paste file

<Tip>
  The file explorer opens on the right side by default. You can change this in `lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua`.
</Tip>

### Harpoon: Lightning-Fast Navigation

Harpoon is your secret weapon for navigating between important files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark Files">
    ```vim
    <leader>H  # Add current file to Harpoon
    ```

    Mark the files you're actively working on (max 9).
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Marked Files">
    ```vim
    <leader>h  # Open Harpoon menu
    ```

    See all your marked files and select one to jump to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Jump Directly">
    ```vim
    <leader>1  # Jump to file 1
    <leader>2  # Jump to file 2
    <leader>3  # Jump to file 3
    # ... up to 9
    ```

    Instantly jump to specific marked files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Typical workflow:** Mark your main files (e.g., component, test file, config) and jump between them with `<leader>1`, `<leader>2`, etc. This is faster than any other navigation method.
</Note>

## LSP: Code Intelligence

### Autocompletion

As you type, nvim-cmp provides intelligent suggestions:

```vim
Ctrl+j / Ctrl+k  # Navigate suggestions
Tab              # Select next suggestion
Enter            # Accept suggestion
Ctrl+Space       # Trigger completion manually
Ctrl+e           # Close completion menu
```

**Example:** Start typing in a TypeScript file:
```typescript
con|  # Type 'con' and you'll see:
      # const, console, constructor, etc.
```

### LSP Actions

With your cursor on a symbol:

```vim
K              # Show hover documentation
gd             # Go to definition
gr             # Go to references
gi             # Go to implementation
<leader>ca     # Code actions (refactorings, fixes)
<leader>rn     # Rename symbol
```

**Example workflow:**
```lua
-- Cursor on 'myFunction'
K   # See documentation
gd  # Jump to definition
gr  # See all usages
<leader>rn  # Rename everywhere
```

### Diagnostics

```vim
<leader>d   # Show line diagnostics
[d          # Previous diagnostic
]d          # Next diagnostic
<leader>q   # Open diagnostics list
```

<Warning>
  Diagnostics only work if the appropriate LSP server is installed. Use `:Mason` to check installed servers.
</Warning>

## Editing Workflows

### Window Management

```vim
<leader>|   # Split vertically
<leader>sh  # Split horizontally
Ctrl+h/j/k/l  # Navigate between splits
<leader>bd  # Close current buffer
<leader>ba  # Close all buffers
```

### Copy/Paste

With `clipboard = "unnamedplus"` enabled:

```vim
y   # Yank (copy) to system clipboard
p   # Paste from system clipboard
```

You can now copy/paste between Neovim and other applications seamlessly.

### Flash: Jump Anywhere

Flash lets you jump to any visible location with minimal keystrokes:

```vim
s   # Start Flash search
    # Type 2 characters where you want to jump
    # Type the highlighted label to jump there
```

**Example:**
1. Press `s`
2. Type `fu` (for "function")
3. Labels appear over each match: `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.
4. Type the label to jump there instantly

## Git Integration

### Neogit

```vim
<leader>gg  # Open Neogit (git status)
```

**Inside Neogit:**
- `s` - Stage/unstage file or hunk
- `c` - Commit (opens commit message editor)
- `P` - Push
- `p` - Pull
- `l` - View log
- `?` - Show help

### Diffview

```vim
:DiffviewOpen    # View changes
:DiffviewClose   # Close diff view
:DiffviewFileHistory  # File history
```

## Quick Configuration

### Change Colorscheme

Edit `lua/leyland/plugins/colorscheme.lua`:

```lua {37}
config = function()
  -- Available themes:
  -- "catppuccin", "tokyonight", "bamboo", 
  -- "onedark", "rose-pine"
  vim.cmd.colorscheme("bamboo")  -- Change this line
end,
```

Restart Neovim or run `:colorscheme <theme_name>`.

### Add Custom Keybindings

Edit `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`:

```lua
-- Add your custom keymaps
keymap.set("n", "<leader>w", "<cmd>w<CR>", { desc = "Save file" })
keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", "<cmd>q<CR>", { desc = "Quit" })
```

### Adjust Options

Edit `lua/leyland/core/options.lua`:

```lua
opt.relativenumber = true   # Relative line numbers
opt.wrap = false            # Don't wrap lines
opt.tabstop = 2             # Tab width
opt.expandtab = true        # Use spaces instead of tabs
```

## Your First Coding Session

Let's put it all together in a typical workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Project">
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/my-app
    nvim
    ```

    You'll see the Alpha dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Main File">
    ```vim
    <leader><leader>  # Fuzzy find
    # Type: index
    # Select: src/index.ts
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Important Files">
    ```vim
    <leader>H  # Mark index.ts as file 1
    
    <leader><leader>  # Find test file
    # Type: test
    # Open: index.test.ts
    <leader>H  # Mark as file 2
    
    <leader>1  # Jump back to index.ts
    ```

    Now you can toggle between files with `<leader>1` and `<leader>2`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Coding with LSP">
    ```typescript
    // Start typing
    function calculateTotal|  # Auto-completion appears
    
    // Hover for docs
    K  # On 'calculateTotal'
    
    // Jump to definition
    gd  # On a function call
    
    // Rename a variable
    <leader>rn  # On variable name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search Your Codebase">
    ```vim
    <leader>/  # Live grep
    # Type: TODO
    # See all TODOs in your project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Your Changes">
    ```vim
    <leader>gg  # Open Neogit
    s           # Stage changes
    c           # Commit
    # Write message and save
    P           # Push
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
